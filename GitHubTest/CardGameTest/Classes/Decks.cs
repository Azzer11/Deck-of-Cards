// Decks should hold cards in them for use and keep track of which cards are still in the deck and which cards have been drawn.
// They should also hold a full deck of 52 standard playing cards and be able to reshuffle cards back into the deck and redistribute the cards in a random order.

    //i have no idea where to start here


    // A deck should contain a list of cards, and methods to shuffle, draw, and discard cards.

    // Suggest thinking about moving the card logic into the Decks class, as it might be more appropriate to manage the cards collectively rather than individually.
    // Then the card only needs to know about itself
